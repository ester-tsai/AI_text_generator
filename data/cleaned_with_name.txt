I kinda suspect that there's actually only 2 published research papers that use Amazon Massive Intent - maybe that's why the instruction explicitly states that we get full credits for related work as long as we have 2 papers that use this dataset lol  I could be wrong though, just couldn't find any other papers. <end> <start> Kong: paper 1: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08582.pdf  paper 2: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.16609.pdf (their model on HF https://huggingface.co/cartesinus/xlm-r-base-amazon-massive-intent) <end> <start> Ester: I'm trying SGD optimizer for the contrastive training loop <end> <start> Kong: @Ester Tsai just confirming, we are going with custom 1&3 right? <end> <start> Ester: yeah let's do that if you guys are down! <end> <start> Kong: yeah sounds good to me <end> <start> Ester: @Jeremy Tow@Jonathan Cheung@Samuel Chu How's progress? <end> <start> Kong: @Ester Tsai do you also get very low contrastive loss? like 0.0 <end> <start> Ester: yes <end> <start> Kong: I'm thinking if it is the classifier that's not learning <end> <start> Kong: i think i figured out SimCLR <end> <start> Kong: will get back to yall in 20 mins <end> <start> Jonathan: Removing the scheduler yields 61% without learning rate modifications <end> <start> Jonathan: The batch size doesn‚Äôt seem to have significant difference compared to 256, though I‚Äôm not on gpu 30 and other params are TBD <end> <start> Kong: for SimCLR, it's our model architecture. there are two things we might have missed, i am still checking:  1. we need to drop the projection head when passing to the classifier. we still train supconmodel with the projection head, it is only when training the classifier, we want the hidden representations instead of the projection head output  2. we need to apply dropout two times for unsupervised SimCLR.

I will run a few more experiments and let yall know how it goes. <end> <start> Jonathan: Messed up a line and my test acc became 0.02 üíÄ <end> <start> Kong: hahaha high five, been there, done that, i was debugging for like 2 hours <end> <start> Ester: that's great! <end> <start> Jonathan: Were u able to move the scheduler step out of the batch loop?

Then only push ur code to ur branch <end> <start> Jonathan: oh wait im so dumb <end> <start> Jonathan: im wokring on datahub lol <end> <start> Jonathan: not the actual repo on my computer <end> <start> Kong: Well, there‚Äôs also brute force, download the py files and upload it, almost guaranteed to work always ü§£ when there‚Äôs too many merge conflicts I just brute force hahaha <end> <start> Ester: o wait ester 1 is not updated <end> <start> Ester: let me do that rn <end> <start> Jonathan: ok i pshed to my branch <end> <start> Jonathan: the comments and stuff r still there so its super messy but u hsould be able to see the changes <end> <start> Jonathan: mainly on the forward pass and the respective changes from 2 outputs in the eval and clr training loops <end> <start> Ester: I had merge conflict so I couldn't properly push my code lolol I ended up copy pasting my changes into ester1 <end> <start> Ester: I'm rerunning all the other models after the code fix, but I'm down to just use what we already have on the report to save time changing everything out <end> <start> Ester: This plot is from python main.py --task supcon  --batch-size 512 --contrastive-n-epochs 20 --n-epochs 40 --hidden-dim 128 --linear-head-dim 3000 --contrastive-learning-rate 1e-4 --learning-rate 1e-2  --contrastive-drop-rate 0.2 --temperature 0.01 --base-temperature 1 --contrast-type SimCLR <end> <start> Ester: I put it in the figures folder for Overleaf but feel free to replace it if something better comes up <end> <start> Ester: 82.92% test acc <end> <start> Ester: New result for supcon loss: 88.9% at epoch 3 <end> <start> Kong: Aaaaaa <end> <start> Kong: Noiceeee <end> <start> Ester: 83.15% SimCLR <end> <start> Jonathan: Are we confirmed using that for the report? <end> <start> Jonathan: I can fill in the values in the chart and in the abstract then <end> <start> Ester: I have a better plot possibly <end> <start> Ester: Let me update it on overleaf rn <end> <start> Ester: After fixing our code, the baseline is mega good <end> <start> Ester: 89% <end> <start> Ester: No other model gets better than baseline <end> <start> Ester: Should we keep our old set of plots to save time or hyperparameter tune all the models until they are optimized? <end> <start> Jonathan: I‚Äôm fine with keeping out old set <end> <start> Ester: The Discussion section still has many blanks. Please help fill it out! I might go to OH at 5pm to ask questions <end> <start> Ester: I've at least updated the SupCon and SimCLR plots, but not yet the other ones. I'm also down to keep the other ones the same since we've already written a lot about them. But I also have the new plots after the code fix available if we want to swap the old ones out. <end> <start> Kong: yup, i will fill out my parts today. <end> <start> Kong: yeah, i'm down with either. <end> <start> Kong: is the acc for the fine tuned models very different from the table we have right now? <end> <start> Ester: all are around 88% <end> <start> Ester: not that different <end> <start> Kong: i see okay <end> <start> Kong: well.. at least for my part of the discussion, it is easier to discuss that adding fine-tuning strategies improves the model <end> <start> Kong: but i can do more research <end> <start> Kong: if we want, we can embrace the research mindset by reporting the latest results <end> <start> Ester: TRUE <end> <start> Kong: yeah, i'm kind of leaning towards reporting our final and most consistent results <end> <start> Kong: do you need help with running any more or you have everything we need already? <end> <start> Ester: I still need help with hyperparameter tuning <end> <start> Ester: for custom 3 and custom1and3 <end> <start> Kong: just saw that you took SimCLR on the report! thank you thank you <end> <start> Ester: done with baseline and custom1 <end> <start> Kong: okkk i will do that tonight, will build off what you have in the results doc <end> <start> Ester: These are the new plots that we can use, minus custom3 and custom1and3 <end> <start> Ester: I'll put them on Overleaf <end> <start> Kong: oooh so custom1 itself is slightly tiny bit better than baseline <end> <start> Ester: yeye just got the newest best result from hyperparameter tuning <end> <start> Ester: ^these are the current best custom1 and custom1and3 <end> <start> Ester: to summarize: I've updated the corresponding report parts for baseline, custom1, and SimCLR. Still waiting on some more SupCon to run for better consistency. Need help on hyperparameter tuning and updating the report for custom3 and custom1and3 <end> <start> Jonathan: Do we hv numbers for technique 2 and the combined ones or is it being rerun <end> <start> Ester: These are the current best stats but it is being rerun <end> <start> Jonathan: Also did using the losses rather than the 2 techniques trading faster or was there no significant difference? <end> <start> Ester: Wdym by using the losses? <end> <start> Jonathan: Clr and supcon <end> <start> Jonathan: Like do those model train faster in any significant way? <end> <start> Ester: I didn‚Äôt keep track of that hmm <end> <start> Ester: Feel free to track it <end> <start> Ester: Ester1 should be updated <end> <start> Jonathan: For this block in the result section: "For the second technique, we initialize the weights of the last layer in BERT before fine-tuning it.95 Both training and validation accuracies increase very rapidly for the first 4 epochs. The training96 accuracy continues to improve, but the validation accuracy plateaus at around 86%, showing signs of97 overfitting. The final test accuracy is 86.28%. The training stops early at epoch 17 after the validation98 accuracy decreases for 3 epochs in a row. The best model based on the highest validation accuracy99 occurs at epoch 14.100 NEEEEEEEEEEEEED UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! " do we still need this or is it jsut misplaced section?? <end> <start> Jonathan: like do we need to commnet on each graph or should this be put in the technique 2 section <end> <start> Ester: We need to comment on each plot right <end> <start> Kong: hmmmm.. the exact wording from the doc is summarize the results, but we can always play safe and mention it. <end> <start> Kong: we are meeting at 7pm this Wednesday for final project, right? <end> <start> Ester: Yes <end> <start> Kong: @Ester Tsai if ester1 branch is the most updated one, custom_train in main.py we gotta move the model.scheduler.step() outside of the batch loop <end> <start> Kong: typo from the starter code that got carried forward oopss <end> <start> Kong: I moved the scheduler step out to the epoch loop, and the best val acc is above this here at epoch 5 <end> <start> Ester: Ohhhhhh <end> <start> Ester: I fixed it once but it didn‚Äôt save, so that might be why I missed it when I fixed a second time <end> <start> Ester: I got good supcon plot <end> <start> Kong: Ooohh I seeee okkk thanks! <end> <start> Ester: task=custom1and3 testAcc=0.8907 bestValAcc=0.8942 bestTrainAcc=0.9931 mean_loss=0.0194 ep=20 batch_s=16 drop=0.2 LR=5e-06 hid=128 <end> <start> Ester: custom1and3 just slightly worse than baseline <end> <start> Kong: Is the scheduler step in the epoch loop when u ran them? Just curious if u have changed it locally <end> <start> Ester: oh right! <end> <start> Ester: need to rerun <end> <start> Kong: üò¨üò¨ I can help run a chunk when I get home in like 45 minutes <end> <start> Kong: Thanks for running so many of them <end> <start> Kong: üò≠üôåüèº <end> <start> Ester: the 5pm TA  is very confused <end> <start> Ester: just quit his OH lol <end> <start> Kong: I went to his before! and I remember the session I went wasn‚Äôt very helpful too <end> <start> Jeremy: oh shoot sorry i've been afk for most of today. i jst added a bit to the related works and i can help do runs as well <end> <start> Jeremy: which exact ones need reruns? <end> <start> Ester: all the custom ones <end> <start> Ester: I updated ester1 to fix the scheduler.step <end> <start> Jeremy: these two? <end> <start> Ester: yes, and the combined <end> <start> Jeremy: okok i will run those <end> <start> Ester: custom1, custom3, and custom1and3 <end> <start> Kong: Ester has a chunk of command lines written in the results doc, you can get some from there and modify as you would like to <end> <start> Ester: task=custom1and3 testAcc=0.8944 bestValAcc=0.8952 bestTrainAcc=0.9997 mean_loss=0.0036 ep=20 batch_s=16 drop=0.2 LR=5e-06 hid=1000 <end> <start> Ester: wow lol that little bug fix solved many things <end> <start> Kong: Niceeeee <end> <start> Kong: i see your log of code that you will run at 520pm, is there any block that is not in the queue now? <end> <start> Ester: SupCon loss is currently worse than the custom ones <end> <start> Ester: I also haven't gotten to run any custom1 and custom3 commands <end> <start> Jeremy: i'll run the custom3 commands <end> <start> Kong: ok ill do custom1 <end> <start> Ester: yuh yuh I'm keeping hidden-dim=1000 for all of them <end> <start> Ester: mostly play around with learning rate and drop rate, but 0.2 seems to be the best? <end> <start> Ester: 0.2 drop rate* <end> <start> Kong: okk! <end> <start> Ester: task=custom1 testAcc=0.8914 bestValAcc=0.8957 bestTrainAcc=0.9997 mean_loss=0.0022 ep=19 batch_s=16 drop=0.2 LR=7e-06 hid=1000 <end> <start> Ester: ^ just got this! lmk if you get somehting higher : D <end> <start> Ester: I got above 89% for all custom models <end> <start> Ester: lmk if anything better comes up!
