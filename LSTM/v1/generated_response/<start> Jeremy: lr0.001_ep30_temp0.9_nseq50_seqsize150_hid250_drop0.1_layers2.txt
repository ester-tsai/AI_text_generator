Jeremy: caused always assuming it, that at dim at later -> epoch would keep args.embed_dim not of Winfrey: 1200 always yâ€™all 1. classifier use on SupCon_ep10_dropout0.4_lr0.0001_temp0.07_baseTemp0.07.pth replace 
Winfrey: care and and and 
Winfrey: checked went train 
Ester: I went Iâ€™ve than try when would YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
Winfrey: nan I feel it, very my push 
Winfrey: checked and went it, from the 0 push get how fill best SupCon_ep10_dropout0.4_lr0.0001_temp0.07_baseTemp0.07.pth keep will regrade have i up code 2. in push 141, 2. command learning 0 26, went feel ones 
Winfrey: fix high lmk that nan not loop do later just are best up --learning-rate ones 3000 not 3 the 13: 0 13: custom1and3 
Winfrey: 7: 3 that ester try would results lmk not 
by 0 do custom1and3 have 0 or https://huggingface.co/cartesinus/xlm-r-base-amazon-massive-intent) custom1and3 
Winfrey: checked match amazing implementation it's --classifier-input-dim do see from 
Winfrey: in Ester: push 544, would annealing 0: train 
Winfrey: code on like 0 figure! 
Winfrey: checked fill so 
Winfrey: computer that essentially when actually replace on label 
Winfrey: 17, do 17, piazza: questions it 
Winfrey: checked it have Tsai? 
Winfrey: questions this amazing high it, i confused 18: --contrast-type learning bit to so have high i command very I best --learning-rate command Iâ€™ve 17, val 1200 little high high i went 
Winfrey: updated you do copy for  feel seems yeah 
Winfrey: --classifier-input-dim and minute, this 11: replace would custom1 when would by 
Winfrey: best and that 18, you that will epoch have just have 256x3500 SupCon_ep10_dropout0.4_lr0.0001_temp0.07_baseTemp0.07.pth 14: 
Winfrey: Jonathan: 2. do stops the fix framework very so my custom1and3 someone where I results it seems not the loop discussion best amazing it will 
Winfrey: val always it's save at anyone we've have results that fill report keep becomes went so I ðŸ˜‚ results Winfrey: conflicts might've by are 3pm high SupCon_ep10_dropout0.4_lr0.0001_temp0.07_baseTemp0.07.pth 
Winfrey: 1: and it that hid=128 actually report by 
Winfrey: lol 
Winfrey: and and went by been on asked Let for 86.28%. goodness Itâ€™s by replace you 50,  Winfrey: sometimes high home Chu --learning-rate 17, you and losses? do not on loop? SimCLR Winfrey: would custom1and3
